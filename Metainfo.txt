Description:      'SFE_BoxJen code introduces the Box-Jenkins Method. First, it
                  simulates an ARMA process and tests it for a unit root with  
                  Dickey Fuller Test. Next, the ACF and PACF of the series are   
                  visually inspected and a function for identifying the best  
                  ARMA model for a given time series according to the AIC   
                  criterion is indroduced. Finally, the best model according to 
                  the above function is being diagnosed.'
